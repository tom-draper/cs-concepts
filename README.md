# Visual Computer Science

A complete guide for Computer Science concepts: one page per concept, read front to back like a book.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and served from GitHub Pages at <https://tom-draper.github.io/vcs/>.

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:4321/vcs/
pnpm build      # static site + search index in dist/
pnpm preview    # serve dist/ (search only works here, not in dev)
```

## How the book is organised

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/outline.ts` | The table of contents: parts, chapters, page titles and reading order. |
| `src/content/docs/<part>/<page>.mdx` | One file per concept. |
| `src/components/viz/` | Diagram components, rendered to inline SVG at build time. |
| `src/components/mdx.ts` | The components every page can use without importing. |

The outline lists every page the book intends to have. A page is **planned**
(greyed out in the sidebar) until its `.mdx` file exists; then it becomes a link
and joins the previous/next chain automatically.

## Adding a concept

1. Find the page in `src/outline.ts`, or add it. Its id is `<part-slug>/<slugified-title>`,
   for example `data-structures/b-trees`.
2. Create `src/content/docs/<id>.mdx`:

   ```mdx
   ---
   description: One sentence that says what it is and why it matters.
   difficulty: beginner # or intermediate, advanced
   ---

   Opening paragraph: the problem this concept solves.

   ## The picture
   ```

The title comes from the outline, and the description is shown under it, so start
the body with prose rather than a heading.

Link to other concepts with site-absolute paths: `[arrays](/data-structures/arrays/)`.
A link to a planned page renders as plain dotted text until that page is written.
A link to a page that is not in the outline fails the build.

### Page shape

The existing pages follow roughly this order, which is worth keeping:

1. The problem the concept solves, in a paragraph.
2. A picture of the structure.
3. Each operation as a worked example, step by step.
4. The costs (`<Ops>`).
5. A short implementation.
6. Trade-offs and where it is used in real systems.
7. Key takeaways.

### Interactive diagrams

`<Player>` turns a sequence of frames into a step-through with play, previous/next
and a scrubber. Each frame is ordinary static markup, so without JavaScript the
frames simply appear one after another.

```mdx
<Player>
<Frame caption="Start with an empty array.">
<ArrayViz values={[null, null]} />
</Frame>
<Frame caption="Write <code>A</code>.">
<ArrayViz values={['A', null]} highlight={[0]} />
</Frame>
</Player>
```

Frames can be generated: `export const order = [1, 2, 3]` and then
`{order.map((key) => <Frame>...</Frame>)}` inside the `<Player>`.

Use `<Steps>` when each step needs a paragraph of explanation, and `<Player>` when
the motion is the point and a one-line caption is enough.

`<SortDemo algorithm="quick" />` animates a sorting algorithm as bars, with
comparison and write counters and buttons to re-run it on shuffled, sorted or
reversed input. Algorithms: `bubble`, `insertion`, `selection`, `merge`, `quick`,
`heap`. The traces live in `src/lib/sort-traces.ts`; add a function there to
support another algorithm.

`<GraphDemo algorithm="bfs" nodes={...} edges={...} />` runs a graph algorithm
step by step on a graph you describe, and lets the reader restart it from any
vertex. Algorithms: `bfs`, `dfs`, `dijkstra`, `topo` (pass `directed` for a DAG).
The traces live in `src/lib/graph-traces.ts`.

`<GraphDemo>` also runs `bellman-ford`, `kruskal` and `prim`. Other algorithm
demos: `<GridSearch />` (draw walls, compare Dijkstra with A*),
`<MatchDemo algorithm="kmp" text="..." pattern="..." />` (also `naive` and
`rabin-karp`), `<EditDistanceDemo />`, `<QueensPlayer n={4} />` and the static
`<Intervals items={[['A', 1, 4]]} chosen={['A']} />`. Their logic is in
`src/lib/grid-search.ts` and `src/lib/string-traces.ts`.

The probabilistic structures have `<BloomDemo />`, `<CountMinDemo />` and
`<HllDemo />`, sharing the hashing in `src/lib/sketches.ts`, and skip lists have
the static `<SkipList nodes={[[3, 1], [9, 3]]} path={[[-1, 2], [9, 2]]} target={9} />`.

The computer architecture pages use `<GateDemo />`, `<AdderDemo />`,
`<RegisterDemo />`, `<CpuDemo />`, `<BranchDemo />` and `<CacheDemo />`, with the
static `<Gates only={['xor', 'and']} />` and
`<Pipeline instructions={['add', 'load']} cycle={3} />`. Their simulations are in
`src/lib/hardware.ts`.

The operating systems pages use `<SchedulerDemo />`, `<PagingDemo />`,
`<PageReplacementDemo />` and `<AllocatorDemo />`, backed by `src/lib/os.ts`.

The concurrency pages use `<InterleaveDemo scenario="race" />` (also `mutex`,
`cas`, `deadlock` and `ordered`), `<SemaphoreDemo />`, `<ChannelDemo />` and
`<EventLoopDemo />`, backed by `src/lib/concurrency.ts`.

The theory of computation pages use `<AutomatonDemo machine="even-zeros" input="1001" />`
(also `divisible-by-3`, `ends-01` and `ends-01-dfa`), `<RegexDemo />`, `<PdaDemo />`,
`<TuringDemo machine="increment" />` (also `equal` and `bounce`), `<LambdaDemo />`,
`<SubsetSumDemo />` and `<SatDemo />`, backed by `src/lib/theory.ts`. The static
`<Automaton machine="ends-01" active={['q0']} />` draws a state diagram, and also
takes a machine written out in full: `{ states: { s: [0, 0], f: [1, 0] }, start: 's',
accept: ['f'], edges: [['s', 'f', 'a'], ['f', 'f', 'a,b']] }`.

The programming languages pages share one small expression language in
`src/lib/languages.ts`. `<CompilerDemo show="tokens" />` runs what the reader types
through a stage of a compiler (also `tree`, `types`, `optimise`, `stack` and `all`;
pass `source` and `tries` to change the examples), and `<VmDemo />` steps the
resulting stack code. The other widgets are `<GcDemo />`, `<ClosureDemo />`,
`<JitDemo />` and `<OwnershipDemo script="move" />` (also `shared`, `mutable` and
`dangling`).

The networking pages use `<SequenceDemo scenario="tcp-handshake" />` for anything that
is a conversation between machines (also `tcp-loss`, `tcp-close`, `udp`, `dns`,
`dns-cached`, `sockets`, `tls`, `tcp-tls`, `quic` and `quic-0rtt`; add a scenario to
`sequences` in `src/lib/networking.ts` for another). The rest are `<SubnetDemo />`,
`<LayersDemo />`, `<CongestionDemo />`, `<HttpDemo />`, `<LoadBalancerDemo />` and
`<CdnDemo />`.

The database pages use `<SqlDemo showTables />`, a SQL prompt over two sample tables
(pass `query` and `tries={[['label', 'SELECT ...']]}` to set the examples). The engine
in `src/lib/databases.ts` handles `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`,
`ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. The other widgets are `<JoinDemo />`, `<IndexDemo />`,
`<LsmDemo />`, `<WalDemo />`, `<PlanDemo />`, `<MvccDemo />` and
`<IsolationDemo anomaly="dirty read" />` (also `non-repeatable read`, `phantom`,
`lost update` and `write skew`).

The distributed systems pages use `<CapDemo />`, `<QuorumDemo />`, `<ClockDemo />`,
`<HeartbeatDemo />`, `<ReplicationDemo />`, `<PartitionDemo />`, `<HashRingDemo />`,
`<RaftDemo />`, `<CrdtDemo />` and `<GossipDemo />`, backed by `src/lib/distributed.ts`.
That file also adds the `2pc-commit`, `2pc-abort`, `2pc-stuck` and `paxos` scenarios
to `<SequenceDemo>`.

The security pages use `<HashDemo />`, `<BlockModeDemo />`, `<RsaDemo />` (and
`<RsaDemo mode="sign" />`), `<DiffieHellmanDemo />`, `<PasswordDemo />`,
`<OverflowDemo />`, `<InjectionDemo />` and `<TokenDemo />`, backed by
`src/lib/security.ts`. The ciphers there are toys sized for reading, not for use.

The data-representation pages have four small widgets, all backed by
`src/lib/bits.ts`: `<BitsDemo value={65} signed step />` (flip bits, read the
value), `<BitwiseDemo />`, `<FloatDemo />` and `<Utf8Demo />`.

The discrete maths pages use `<LogicDemo />`, `<ModClock value={17} modulus={12} />`,
`<CountingDemo />`, `<BirthdayDemo />` and the static `<Venn />`, with their maths
in `src/lib/discrete.ts`.

In page prose, wrap anything containing curly braces (such as set notation) in
backticks. MDX treats a bare `{` as the start of a JavaScript expression.

`<HashPlayground />` is a live widget for the Hash Functions page. Widgets like
it are custom elements with a script that only ships on pages that use them.

`highlight` is the blue emphasis and `alt` the orange one. In a tree node, a
number is a leaf, an array is one multi-key node, `null` is an empty child slot
and `{ k, c }` is a node with children.
